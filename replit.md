## User Preferences
I prefer detailed explanations and iterative development. Ask before making major changes. I value clear communication regarding the agent's actions and decisions.

## System Architecture
**UI/UX Enhancement - Chakra UI Integration (November 5, 2025):** The web application has been upgraded with Chakra UI components throughout the onboarding profile page, delivering a professional, polished aesthetic with custom purple theme (#7c3aed). The implementation includes Card/CardHeader/CardBody sections, Input/Textarea with 'filled' variant for modern form aesthetics, Select dropdowns for 13 preference fields, Slider for distance selection (5-100km), Modal components, Tag chips for interests, Grid layouts, and comprehensive theming. SSR hydration issues were resolved by removing resetCSS from ChakraProvider. The mobile app received parallel aesthetic enhancements using native React Native components with STYLES constants (card shadows, filled input backgrounds #F7FAFC, enhanced button styling with platform-specific iOS/Android shadows), delivering cross-platform visual consistency. Location (TEXT) and max_distance (INTEGER DEFAULT 50) database columns were added to support geographic matching preferences on both platforms.

**Comprehensive Chakra UI Aesthetic Refactoring (November 5, 2025):** Complete platform-wide aesthetic enhancement of Consent, Subscription Management, and Admin Dashboard pages. Web pages now exclusively use Chakra UI primitives (Card, Button, Table, Stat, Alert, Progress, Badge, Input, FormControl, FormLabel, VStack, HStack, SimpleGrid, Divider) with zero Tailwind className usage, maintaining consistent purple brand theme (#7c3aed via purple colorScheme). Mobile pages utilize native React Native STYLES with platform-specific shadows (iOS shadowColor/shadowOffset, Android elevation) for professional native feel. Admin dashboard includes User Photo Management (Table with photo previews, delete/restore actions, violation tracking), Revenue Overview (Stat components for 4-tier membership metrics and scheduled downgrades), and Pricing Settings (Chakra form controls for subscription tier configuration and second date fees). All refactored pages validated for zero functional regressions and complete Chakra adoption via comprehensive code review.

**Phase 1 Core Pages Chakra UI Refactoring (November 5, 2025):** Successfully completed comprehensive Chakra UI migration of 6 core application pages, fully replacing Tailwind markup with Chakra components while preserving all functionality. Refactored pages: Discovery (`/discovery`) with swipeable Framer Motion cards + Chakra Box/Card/Button/Progress/Badge, Matches List (`/matches`) with Card-based display + Avatar components, Messages List (`/messages`) with conversation Cards + timestamp formatting, Individual Chat (`/messages/[matchId]`) with complete messaging interface including Modal components for video calls/credit purchase, FormControl/Input/Textarea for messaging, quota UI with Progress bars, Private Notes drawer, and real-time message handling, Profile View (`/profile/[userId]`) with comprehensive media gallery using Chakra Image/SimpleGrid/Badge/IconButton, and Own Profile (`/profile`) with full form implementation using Input/Switch/FormControl/FormLabel for name/timezone/availability editing, photo/video uploads with tier limits, and action buttons. All pages maintain purple brand theme (#7c3aed via purple colorScheme), professional card-based layouts with consistent spacing/shadows, and zero functional regressions. Critical import fix applied: corrected useUser hook from named import to default import (`import useUser from "@/utils/useUser";`) across 4 pages (Matches, Messages, Chat, Own Profile) to prevent runtime crashes. Architect review confirmed complete Chakra adoption, functional completeness, and production-ready quality standards.

**Phase 2 Tier 1+2 Chakra UI Refactoring (November 5, 2025):** Completed refactoring of 7 additional high-priority web pages with comprehensive Chakra UI adoption, eliminating all Tailwind className usage. Tier 1 (highest-use pages): New Matches (`/new-matches`) with celebration modal, match cards using Card/Badge/Avatar/Button components, HStack/VStack layouts, and purple colorScheme buttons; Likers (`/matches/likers`) with user cards showing who liked the user, SimpleGrid layouts, IconButton for quick actions, and Spinner loading states; Profile Viewers (`/profile-viewers`) with reverse discovery UI showing recent profile viewers, timestamp formatting, and consistent card-based layouts; Daily Picks (`/daily-picks`) with curated match recommendations, compatibility scores, Badge indicators, and responsive grid layouts. Tier 2 (settings/profile management): Profile Media Management (`/profile/media`) with complex VideoRecorderModal fully converted to Chakra Modal/ModalOverlay/ModalContent/ModalHeader/ModalBody/ModalCloseButton, Box as="video" for camera recording, IconButton overlays for delete actions, SimpleGrid photo/video galleries, and tier-based upload limits UI; Profile Preview (`/profile/preview`) with read-only profile display matching user view perspective; Settings Blockers (`/settings/blockers`) with blocked users management, unblock actions, and empty state messaging. All 7 pages architect-reviewed and production-ready with zero LSP errors, zero className usage (grep verified), consistent purple brand theme (#7c3aed via purple/pink colorScheme), professional spacing/shadows, and zero functional regressions. Total web pages refactored with Chakra UI: 14 pages (6 Phase 1 + 7 Tier 1+2 + 1 Subscription already completed).

The application utilizes a client-server architecture with a React 18 frontend employing React Router 7 for navigation, Chakra UI for component library (web), and TailwindCSS for utility styling (being phased out), featuring a mobile-first UI/UX with Tinder-style profile cards and gradient overlays. Routing uses Next.js-style route grouping. The backend is built with Hono (Node.js) and interacts with a PostgreSQL database. Auth.js handles authentication. Key features include Discovery, Matches, Messages with real-time chat, Profile management, and a consolidated onboarding flow. An `ErrorBoundary` ensures graceful error handling.

The system incorporates a 4-tier membership model (Free, Casual, Dating, Business) governing media limits, chat durations, and meeting caps, enforced both client-side and via backend API. A real-time video call extension system allows paid extensions with synchronized timers. Safety features include a 4-strike moderation logic. Core features include smart matching with prioritization, mutual interests highlighting, activity-based matching, conversation starters, Daily Picks, and Reverse Discovery (profile viewers). Media management supports photo uploads and camera-only video recording with tier-based limits. Revenue-protection downgrade flows are implemented for subscription management.

Authentication is managed by a global authentication guard that protects all routes except public pages (`/welcome`, `/onboarding/*`), redirecting unauthenticated users to `/welcome`. A two-step authentication process first verifies user credentials, then checks for onboarding completion (consent, membership, profile photos) before directing users to `/discovery`. UX enhancements include optimistic UI updates, loading skeletons, and an `ErrorBoundary`. Security measures include webhook monitoring, idempotency keys, database-backed rate limiting, and database constraints.

Data integrity and performance are managed through database indexes and central configuration of all limits, thresholds, and pricing. A client-side session monitor ensures secure session management. Code quality and scalability are maintained through Vitest integration tests, TypeScript migration of payment endpoints, a production-ready feature flag system, and structured logging for business events. User experience features include a private user notes system and an admin dashboard for user photo management.

A hybrid chat monetization system uses a three-pool message deduction with per-match caps for the Business tier. Video call completion incentivizes messaging, and credit packs are available for purchase. A real-time quota UI displays remaining messages. The mobile app upload system uses base64 encoding for media uploads, resolving compatibility issues. Video recording limits are tier-based. A unified `/api/upload-base64` endpoint handles various input types.

An enhanced matching system incorporates a comprehensive interests system and a weighted scoring algorithm (v2) for compatibility calculation, considering shared interests, relationship goals, lifestyle, activity, and tier similarity. The Discovery UI displays compatibility percentages, "Likes You" indicators, bio previews, and shared interests. All preferences, weights, and interests are centrally configured.

The mobile application features full parity with the web app experience, including comprehensive profile viewing pages (`/profile/[userId]`), fully editable profile tabs, and smart media handling for uploads. A 6-tab bottom navigation system (Discovery, New Matches, Matches, Messages, Membership, Profile) provides consistent navigation. Quick access buttons in Discovery lead to Daily Picks and Profile Viewers. Aesthetic uniformity is maintained across mobile and web with consistent colors, fonts, spacing, shadows, and card styling. Real-time badge systems for unviewed matches are implemented.

Mobile API integration uses a centralized `apiFetch` helper for authentication and `getAbsoluteUrl()` for proper media loading across all screens. Profile availability controls (Show as Online, Appear Offline, Accept Video Calls) are implemented across both web and mobile, with server-side persistence via `/api/profile` and synchronization. The chat interface respects the `video_call_available` status of the match partner. Both platforms feature a Profile Preview page, allowing users to see how their profile appears to others.
