✖ Check for common project setup issues
The .expo directory is not ignored by Git. It contains machine-specific device history and development server settings and should not be committed.
Advice:
Add ".expo/" to your .gitignore to avoid committing local Expo state.
✖ Check that no duplicate dependencies are installed
Your project contains duplicate native module dependencies, which should be de-duplicated.
Native builds may only contain one version of any given native module, and having multiple versions of a single Native module installed may lead to unexpected build errors.
Found duplicates for react:
  ├─ react@19.1.0 (at: node_modules/react)
  └─ react@17.0.1 (at: node_modules/expo-three/node_modules/react)
Found duplicates for react-native-safe-area-context:
  ├─ react-native-safe-area-context@5.6.2 (at: node_modules/react-native-safe-area-context)
  └─ react-native-safe-area-context@4.5.0 (at: node_modules/react-native-calendars/node_modules/react-native-safe-area-context)
Advice:
Resolve your dependency issues and deduplicate your dependencies. Learn more: https://expo.fyi/resolving-dependency-issues
